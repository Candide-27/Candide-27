### Hi there! I'm Thong - aka [Candide-27]ðŸ‘‹

## I'm an Economics student that have an insatiable desire for coding!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m specialized in & currently working on Stata for causal identification via methods such as Diff-in-Diff, IVs and Regression Discontinuity.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning and working with Python in data cleansing & visualization, while having fun trying to automate boring stuff. 
- ðŸŒ± I'm interested in gleaning insights from the financial market using Python!
- ðŸ‘¯ Near future vision: Collaborating with others on Github projects :)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm obsessed with history and theology, and a hardcore fan of Voltaire (hence my name)!

## My latest small project:
